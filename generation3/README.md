## Update

'ppp' used to stand for 'people, programming, property' and was a project designed to improve an individuals life by applying the scientific method to self help.

the basis of 'ppp' was that if one can improve their understanding of the 'foundational' subject areas: 
### people; programming and technology; and housing and property markets 
they would have all the know-how required to live a better life.

at the end of generation 2 we came to understand that these subject areas were not as foundational as we thought going into the project

now that we are on generation 3 and we have a better understanding of what the foundational subject areas might be, we will proceed building upon those:
### health, art and credibility

as a hommage to the original concept, we will be keeping the name 'ppp' :)
