# Update 1-jun-21

'ppp' used to stand for 'people, programming, property' and was a project designed to improve an individuals life by applying the scientific method to self help.

the basis of 'ppp' was that if one can improve their understanding of the 'foundational' subject areas: 
### people; programming and technology; and housing and property markets 
they would have all the know-how required to live a better life.

at the end of generation 2 we came to understand that these subject areas were not as foundational as we thought going into the project

now that we are on generation 3 and we have a better understanding of what the foundational subject areas might be, we will proceed building upon those:
### health, art and credibility

as a hommage to the original concept, we will be keeping the name 'ppp' :)

# FAQ

## What is this?

it's a self help project designed to be a 'software for the mind' to improve one's living experience.

## What does this 'software' do?

It's designed to help and individual improve their life.

## How did this project start?

It started as a way to organise and cross-reference self-help articles to try to find a rigourous throughline 'protocol' - "what are the foundational things that all 'self help' content promote?".

## What is the future of this project?

As more and more resources and 'code' is added to the project the plan is to organise in a way that is accessible to an uninitiated person. We believe it is not at that state at the moment.
