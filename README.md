training human brain for quantitatively pre-defined notion of success

## the philosophy
  - human brains must use some sort of algorithm for training itself and the body to learn a wide variety of skills.
  - this algorithm uses seems similar in nature to [machine learning][1], 
  using input from our senses and information to train from

i am going to attempt to train a human brain as efficiently as possible using principles from [reinforcement learning][2]

## train for what?

the ultimate goal is to be a "successful person", where "success" is arbitrarily defined by mastery of the skills listed below:
  - [_social skills_][3]; skills with dealing with other people. this is most difficult because people's personalities vastly vary 
  - [_financial skills_][4]; with which "financial skills" has been specified as "investment skills on the property market"
  - [_technical computer skills_][5]; skills with using technology. this is the easiest due to the algorithmic nature of technology.
