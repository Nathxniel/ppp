15-12-17 "overfitting for breadth"
>>>
it is possible to reach the strategy goal
"to have all positive social interactions"
by maximising agreability

take for example the skill of speaking a language
say, speaking french.

one non-french speaker can learn to speak french
_just_ well enough to be understood by all french
speakers, but still not "perfectly" by any means.

for example, he could pronounce all of the words
incorrectly but the native french speakers can still
understand him

essentially, strive for perfection

31-12-17 UB and CB separate people, malice
>>>
the UB and CB can be thought of as 2 separate people
who recide inside one body.

perhaps thats how i think about it now

also when strategising, it is safer to reason with 
the assumption that nobody knows what they are doing
i.e. people dont always sin on purpose

01-01-18 neg interaction
>>>
it seems that a reliable source of negativity is from
situations where 2 people care about each other and live differently

if they lived the same they would do the same things and be negative
at the same times which would mean they could perfectly empathise
with each other etc etc

interesting to consider

also you cannot dismiss negativity because they creates
uncertainty, which is also negative.
you just need to work hard to surmount it
(perhaps with CB?)

25-01-18 reality manipulation
>>>
the ability to do what you want
that requires some level of control over events
events are bound to reality

there exists reality within perception
there exists reality within dreams
there are realities that are created (videogames)

realities have rules
knowing them seems to play a part in ability 
to manipulate them


being ill seems to inhibit reality manipulation
