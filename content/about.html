  <h3 id="people">personal life</h3>
  <div>
      The playfulness of youth has always stayed with me. I like doing as wide of a variety of things as possible, and I find meeting new people the most fascinating activity. 
      </div><br/><div>
      Right now I mostly get up to:
      </div><br/><div>
      caving, jiu jitsu, video gaming, running, music production, programming, designing, cocktail making, and <i>researching effective training of the human brain for quantitively pre-defined notions of success</i>. (For more information on that last one, check out my "ppp project" on github)
      </div><br/><div>
