15-12-17 "overfitting for breadth"
>>>
it is possible to reach the strategy goal
"to have all positive social interactions"
by maximising agreability

take for example the skill of speaking a language
say, speaking french.

one non-french speaker can learn to speak french
_just_ well enough to be understood by all french
speakers, but still not "perfectly" by any means.

for example, "he pronounced all of the words
technically incorrectly, but 
the native french speakers still understood him"

(moral of the story: just strive for perfection)

31-12-17 UB and CB separate people, malice
>>>
the UB and CB can be thought of as 2 separate people
who recide inside one body.

perhaps thats how i think about it now

also when strategising, it is safer to reason with 
the assumption that nobody knows what they are doing
i.e. people dont always sin on purpose

01-01-18 neg interaction
>>>
it seems that a reliable source of negativity is from
situations where 2 people care about each other and live differently

if they lived the same they would do the same things and be negative
at the same times which would mean they could perfectly empathise
with each other etc etc

interesting to consider

also you cannot dismiss negativity because they creates
uncertainty, which is also negative.
you just need to work hard to surmount it
(perhaps with CB?)

25-01-18 reality manipulation
>>>
the ability to do what you want
that requires some level of control over events
events are bound to reality

there exists reality within perception
there exists reality within dreams
there are realities that are created (videogames)

realities have rules
knowing them seems to play a part in ability 
to manipulate them


being ill seems to inhibit reality manipulation

02-02-18 learning to let go
>>>
we have some level of control over our lives
and so knowing a bit about how people work and
how the mind works makes you feel like you
have a lot of power and agency over the universe

i think letting go of this feeling is important

08-02-18 work and play revisited
>>>
the relationship between work and play seems to
be similar to the relationship between science
and art

science is creation/discovery, art is commentary
we observe the world and either:

- create new rules for it/ discover the rules for it 
  (science)
- express our "opinion" on it through some medium; 
  be it painting, music, language etc

23-01-18 impossible to fuck up
>>>
it is impossible to make a bad decision
it is impossible to not do what you want
dont take everything so seriously
life is a game
we are all kids in a playground at the end of the day

kids that hate you are just sad that you hate them
kids that talk to you like you
kids that keep wanting to talk to you love you

love is understanding, hate is misunderstanding

adults are just socially promoted kids
god is the generation 1 being

amen

what is sobriety?

to me theres 3 levels in a cycle.
the order is as follows:

zoning is fine, but its not real
i feel like im acting slightly

sober is peak because i have no
idea what is actually going on
