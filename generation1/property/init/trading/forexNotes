buying and selling pairs
pairs are in the form BASE/QUOTE
e.g. EUR/USD
  - you "buy the pair" if you think EUR will INCREASE against USD (going long)
  - you "sell the pair" if you think EUR will DECREASE against USD (going short)

a pip is 0.0001 movement (except from when quote is yen)
a standard lot is 100,000 units of base currency

buyers are bulls
sellers are bears

ask price is price you pay as the buyer (aka offer price)
bid price is price you receive as the seller
  - the difference between the two is the "spread"

  - set your parameters (how much are you willing to lose)
  - know your risk appetite (how ofen are you willing to lose)
