# Notes

### substances seem to have noticable effects on the CB
  - cannabinoids appear to have an effect on the 
    processing speed of the CB (both speeding up _and_ slowing down),
    but not seem to have an effect on UB
  - alcohol appears to suppress the CB (its "harder to think"),
    which allows more room for UB to take control
