# Training strategy

This is the "algorithm" that will be used to train the brain.
It uses psychological [_"self improvement"_][1] concepts 
for **mental clarity**, 
as well as the main reinforcement learning philosophy of
[_exploration and exploitation_][2]

```
if(inSocialEnvironment()) {
  //do not think
} else {
  //think about goal
}
```

## when in social environments 
conscious and unconscious parts of the brain play different parts in learning.
when in a social environment unconscious brain is needed to exploit/explore,
as to train and use/test skills where appropriate.

### minimize thought (focus)
try to steer all thoughts towards these:
  1. "how do i feel?"
  2. "what do i really want to do _RIGHT NOW_?"

don't think about abstract concepts such as 
  - "life" 
  - "the nature of reality"
  - _"what type of person am i?"_

**try to remember the positive evaluations 
of self-identified personal character traits
when thoughts become introspective**

give people benefit of the doubt
  - "X only said Y because they want to be friends"
  - "X is just a shy person, not rude"

**essentially, always turn towards positivity.**

## when alone
when alone, conscious brain is used to, _as best as possible_, help 
the unconscious brain develop and/reinforce strategy.

### recite ambition (re-inforcement)
`i want to...`
  - have
    a [_net worth_](./reference/netWorth.md) of Â£56 million 
    by age 40
  - be recognised by 
    [_everyone_](./reference/quantitativePopularity.md) 
    by age 27
  - have 
    all-positive social interactions
    by age 27
  - have 
    maximum proffesional knowlegde of 
    all current (2017) computer systems
    by age 27

### strategise (development)
think about what type of descriptions you want to have of yourself
  - reflect on past social interactions
  - strategise on upcoming events without planning 
    any physical actions (_speaking_)
  - think about how you want to *feel* for each upcoming interaction
