# Training strategy

This is the "algorithm" that will be used to train the brain.
It uses psychological [_"self improvement"_][si] concepts 
for **mental clarity**, 
as well as the main reinforcement learning philosophy of
[_exploration and exploitation_][ee]

[si]: ../doc/self_help
[ee]: ../../programming/ML/DA-Lecture9.pdf "learn about this"

conscious and unconscious parts of the brain play different parts in learning.
we conjecture that[\*][cs]:
  - (1) unconscious brain (UB) and conscious brain (CB) both have decision making capabilities
  - (2) UB has more "processing power" than the CB
  - (3) UB and CB can both be influenced
  - (4) CB can influence UB
  - (5) UB stores concepts of "skill" and "personality"
  - (6) CB is easier to "convince" then UB

## when alone
**when alone or idle, the CB appears to be most active.**

we would like:
  - CB to only positively influence UB towards goals
  - CB to be used to reflect on recent interactions[\*][nt]

we would not want:
  - CB to "distract" UB from goals

therefore, CB is used to help the UB 
to develop and reinforce strategy _as best as possible_.
time spent alone should be used to:

[nt]: ./reference/notes.md

### recite ambition (re-inforcement)
`i want to...`
  - have
    a [_net worth_](./reference/netWorth.md) of Â£56 million 
    by age 40
  - be recognised by 
    [_everyone_](./reference/quantitativePopularity.md) 
    by age 27
  - have 
    all-positive social interactions
    by age 27
  - have 
    maximum proffesional knowlegde of 
    all current (2017) computer systems
    by age 27

### strategise (development)
think about what type of descriptions you want to have of yourself
  - think about how you felt in previous interactions, and 
    think about how you want to feel for each upcoming interaction
    (strategise on upcoming events without planning 
    any physical actions, i.e. speaking)
  - think about any negative emotions were experienced in past
    interactions, and think about why they could have been felt
    (but be positive)

## when in social environments 
**when in social environments, the UB seems to be more effective/
  useful than CB**

(Conjecture: social environments are too complicated for the
weaker CB[\*][c4] to process, so UB is most effective)

[c4]: ./STRATEGY.md "conjecture 4"

therefore, we would like UB to have more control in social
environments and for CB to only be used to guide UB. similarly
to [_when alone_][wa]:

[wa]: ./STRATEGY.md "(above)"

we would like:
  - CB to only positively influence UB towards goals
  - CB to be used when required (e.g. to [_empathise_][ei], or to have conversation)

we would not want:
  - CB to "distract" UB from goals

[ei]: ../doc/emotional_intelligence/danielGoleman.pdf "ref. on page 39"

UB is needed to exploit/explore as to train and utelise skills where appropriate.

### minimize thought (focus)
try to steer all thoughts towards these:
  1. "how do i feel?"
  2. "what do i really want to do _RIGHT NOW_?"

don't think about abstract concepts such as 
  - "life" 
  - "the nature of reality"
  - _"what type of person am i?"_

remember:
  - be [positive][pp]
  - listen
