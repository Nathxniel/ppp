# Training strategy

this is the "algorithm" that will be used to train the brain

the mind seems to operate in a way that can be described 
"conscious" and "unconscious" (or "subconcious")

the "conscious brain" (CB) and "unconscious brain" (UB) 
perhaps play different roles in learning

therefore to reason about the functionality of the brain, 
first of all we conjecture that[\*][cs]:
  - `(1) UB and CB can both be influenced`
  - `(2) UB and CB can both influence each other`

based on these conjectures and the sources in [src](../src),
we create conjectures and operate under the principles they outline as 
to test their validity and effectiveness

## A) - memories, opinions, personality
`(3) the CB and UB work together to update UB;` 
`(4) the UB stores memories, opinions and personality;`

thoughts that sprout from the CB are based on some combination of
experiences, memories, opinions and (current) personality,
which we will define as the _state_ of the mind, and we conjecture
that the state of the mind is stored in the UB

the emotional responses to these thoughts are what 
provoke change in the state of the UB

## B) - when in social environments 
`(5) UB is larger than CB in some abstract notion of capacity;`

social environments have too much information for 
the smaller CB to manage, so UB is most effective

therefore, we would like UB to have more control in social
environments[\*][nt]

## C) - thinking
`(6) "thinking" is done in CB;`

we would like CB to only positively influence UB towards goals,
therefore thinking should be used to help the UB 
to develop and reinforce strategy _as best as possible_

e.g., "i want to..."
  - have
    a [_net worth_][nw] of Â£56 million 
  - be recognised by 
    [_everyone_][al]
  - be liked by everyone
    ([_all-positive social interactions_][ap])
  - have 
    proffesional knowledge of [_all computer systems_][cp]

this can be done in many ways [\*][nt]
