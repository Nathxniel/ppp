# Training strategy

this is the algorithm that will be used to train the brain

the mind seems to operate in a way that can be described 
**conscious** and **unconscious** (or **subconcious**)

the **conscious brain** (CB) and **unconscious brain** (UB) 
play different roles in learning[\*][cs]

## when alone

use CB to create the reality that you live in:
- i have a [property net worth][nw] of Â£56 million
- i am recognised by [everyone][al]
- i have [all-positive][ap] social interactions
- i know [everything][cp] about computer systems

## when in social environments 

be consistent with intent and pay attention to nothing else

social environments have too much information for 
the smaller CB to manage, so UB is most effective for action
(assuming action is based on the actor choosing to "follow"
the wants of the CB versus the UB)

substances can be helpful or harmful for this strategy.
