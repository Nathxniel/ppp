# Notes

### substances seem to have noticable effects on the CB
conjecture: CB stores "short term memory"
  - cannabinoids appear to have an effect on the 
    processing speed of the CB (both speeding up _and_ slowing down),
    but not seem to have an effect on UB
  - alcohol appears to suppress the CB (its "harder to think"),
    which allows more room for UB to take control
  - alprazolam appears to **completely** suppress the CB. although this
    is useful to allow UB to take control, CB seems to have such little
    functionality that it is essentially useless.
