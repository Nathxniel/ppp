it is possible to reach the strategy goal
"to have all positive social interactions"
by maximising agreability

take for example the skill of speaking a language
say, speaking french.

one non-french speaker can learn to speak french
_just_ well enough to be understood by all french
speakers, but still not "perfectly" by any means.

for example, he could pronounce all of the words
incorrectly but the native french speakers can still
understand him

essentially, strive for perfection
