cards
>>>
the number of copies of a card you can have depends on rarity
  - you can have 3 copies of common cards
  - you can have 2 copies of semi-limited cards
  - you can have 1 copy of limited edition cards
  - you cannot have any copies of forbidden cards

tokens are dropped by some monsters effects
they are not part of any deck and do not get sent to graveyard
they can either be on field in a monster zone or not in play

"leaving the field" means leaving the field anyhow except:
  - becoming an xyz material
  - getting *shuffled* into the main deck

"cards on the field" means everything on the field except:
  - graveyard 
  - deck 
  - extra deck

if the opp has control over a card and it is 
sent to graveyard or returned to deck/hand
it goes to back to the *owner* in the respective place

a card is "destroyed" only if it was battled to death
discarding is sending to the graveyard

equipped monsters are considered as equip spells
once a monster is equipped to another it cannot move
an "equip card" is a card with anything equipped
destroying or flipping down a monster sends equip to graveyard
<<<

misc
>>>
"excavate" means reveal cards to both players

"paying a cost" happens before card play regardless of effect success

"peircing battle damage" is LP = LP - |ur ATK - opp DEF|

"revealing" a card means showing to both players, flip effects dont proc

after "searching your deck" for a card it must be shuffled as per prep

when a banished card is moved to graveyard it is not considered "sent"

you can tribute faceup or facedown cards
